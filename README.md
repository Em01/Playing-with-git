# Learning GitHub

This repository was created as we learnt how to use GitHub during our first week at Makers Academy. The aim of the project was to become familiar and comfortable using GitHub.

Sublime Text was the chosen text editor for this project which used one branch. Contributors were Emma Williams, Louise Lai, Joseph Wolf, Julieann Walker and our coach Enrique Comba Riepenhausen.
